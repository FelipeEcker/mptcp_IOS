## About:

   Mpctp is a tool for raw packets manipulation that allows a large number of
   options. Its primary purpose is diagnose and test several scenarios that
   involving the use of TCP/IP packets. It's capable to send packets to any
   target type (like hostnames, IPs and MAC address) and manipulate many
   fields and headers like: Source/Destination IP address,
   Source/Destination MAC address, TCP flags, ICMP types, TCP/UDP/ICMP packet
   size, payloads ARP/RARP, etc.

   Mptcp is also able to be managed over the RSOI mode
   (Remote System over IRC), where the software can surrender all control and
   machine resources to one channel on an remote IRC server.
   Also, too many types of network based attacks (like packet attacks) also
   are handled by MpTcp.
